// cmd_img
//
// A command image is a non-runnable instance of a command.
// That is, a command image only contains the data for the command,
// (i.e., the script (non-executable), configuration file and dependency files)
// and is located at at the directory /usr/lib/eefenn-cli/<command-name>
//
// The command image also maintains the integrity of the file structure of the command.
